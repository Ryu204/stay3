# ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

**stay3** is a game framework allowing rapid development... to be continued.

As of document writing (01/2025), only Ninja and Visual Studio support modules.

However, currently `EnTT` failed to build if used inside a module with MSVC.

# Demo

Since the web version makes use of some features that are not wildly supported yet, it's recommended viewer use a Chromium based browser on desktop.

In order to run the test, please go to `chrome://flags` on the search bar and enable:
* Experimental WebAssembly JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI)
* Unsafe WebGPU Support

Alternately, you can directly go to the address and enable the flags:
* `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-webassembly-jspi`
* `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`

# Important note

1. Coordinate system is left handed, and positive rotation means clockwise. For example, 90 deg rotation around X+ axis is from Y+ to Z+.

2. Angle unit is radians, `radians` is alias of float.

3. The framework follows a tree hierarchy. Root node is created by a `tree_context` instance.

4. ECS is supported by attaching arbitrary amount of entities to each node, and use the registry provided by `tree_context`.

5. Any class act as multiple system types. Requirements are having public methods with:
* correct names
* arguments convertible to types in following table.

|system type|method name|argument(s)|
|-----------|-----------|--------|
|`sys_type::start`|`start`|`tree_context&`|
|`sys_type::update`|`update`|`seconds`, `tree_context&`|
|`sys_type::post_update`|`post_update`|`seconds`, `tree_context&`|
|`sys_type::render`|`render`|`tree_context&`|
|`sys_type::cleanup`|`cleanup`|`tree_context&`|
|`sys_type::input`|`input`|`const event&`,`tree_context&`|

```cpp
import stay3;
using namespace st;

class my_type;
struct system {
    // Qualified as start system
    bool start(const tree_context&) const;
    
    // Qualified as an update system
    static my_type update(double delta_time, tree_context& ctx);
    
    /* ... */
};
```

6. Systems can use `tree_context&` to access and manipulate components

```cpp
struct component { int value{}; };
struct my_system {
    static void update(seconds, tree_context &ctx) {
        auto sum = 0;
        for(auto &&[en, comp]: ctx.ecs().each<component>()) {
            // `comp` provides pointer-like interface to component
            sum -= comp->value;
            // Or dereference
            sum += 2 * (*comp).value;
        }
        std::cout << "Sum = " << sum << '\n';
    }
};
```
If you want to modify the component, replace `component` with `mut<component>`. This however may be a litle bit slower [^1].

The syntax is so dumb because I wanted to make it possible to automatically react to changes after users are done with `each` or `get`, which means `comp` must be some proxy tricky class to report the change in destructor. To actually get the component reference, I have to call a method or operator on `comp`. `->` and `*` seems to take least number of characters.

[^1]: mutable version will have the destructor invoke the update signal (if somebody subcribed to it before).

7. System can add callback to certain events related to component, including `construct`, `update` and `destroy`.
```cpp
// All component signal handlers share this method
void on_entity_construct(ecs_registry& reg, entity en) {
    std::cout << "Entity constructed\n";
}
struct my_system {
    static void start(tree_context &ctx) {
        ctx.ecs()
            .on<comp_event::construct, my_component_class>()
            .connect<&on_entity_construct>();
    }
};
```
This is the (non exhaustive) list of available events.
|Event|Trigger time|Causes|
|-----|------------|------|
|construct|**After** the component is created|`emplace`, `emplace_if_not_exist`, `emplace_or_replace`|
|update|**After** the component is changed|`patch` or `replace`<br>`each` or `get` or `emplace` variants with a non const type parameter and the proxy goes out of scope|
|destroy|**Before** the component is removed|`destroy`, `destroy_if_exist` (either the component or the whole entity)|

8. To signal exit from inside a system method, use `sys_run_result` as a return type:

```cpp
struct my_system {
    static sys_run_result update(seconds, tree_context &) {
        /* Do something here and realize we need to quit */
        return sys_run_result::exit;
    }
};
```

9. It's possible to iterate over `node` and its entities holder:

```cpp
node& my_node = /* ... */
for (auto& child : my_node) {
    /* child is reference to child node */
}
for (auto entity : my_node.entities()) {
    /* entity belongs to my_node */
}
```

10. There are multiples signals published during the execution:
* `ecs_registry`:
    * `on<comp event, type>`: Signal related to components. Handlers should never add or remove component from any entity if it's observing the same type.
    * `on_entity_destroyed`: An entity is about to be destroyed, it is no longer related to the scene tree. Handlers should never add new component to it.
* `entities_holder`:
    * `on_destroyed`: An entity it owns is destroyed. The entity is still considered owned by holder and its node in the handler.
    * `on_created`: An entity is created and associated with the holder and its node.
* `tree_context`:
    * `on_entity_destroyed`: same with `entities_holder::on_destroyed`, but with `node&` as extra argument.
    * `on_entity_created`:same with `entities_holder::on_created`.

tl;dr:
* Entity signals emitted from ecs registry do not have associations with scene tree anymore (`tree_context::get_node` will not work)
* Never attach components to entity that is signaled to be destroyed
* Never add or destroy component in signal handler of that component.
* Components destruction order of a destroyed entity is not deterministic so you shouldn't perform arbitrary registry manipulation in the handler.

11. There is currently a primitive way to specify a dependency relationship between components. Definition:

Component `deps` is considered a dependency of component `base` in the registry if:
> For every entity `e` with `base`, it has a `deps`. 

This ensures whenever a system queries entities with `base`, they will have following `deps`s (hence the keyword *dependency*).

2 ways to specify dependency relationship:

```cpp
// Adds `deps` when `base` is added, and removes it when `base` is removed
template<component deps, component base, typename... args>
void make_hard_dependency(ecs_registry &reg, args &&...arguments);

// Considers `deps` a dependency if when `base` is added, `deps` does not exist
template<component deps, component base, typename... args>
void make_soft_dependency(ecs_registry &reg, args &&...arguments);
```

In soft version, when `base` is added to `e`, if it already has a `deps`, deletion of `e`'s `base` will not trigger deletion of `deps`, otherwise the behavior is identical to hard version. In other word, hard version is owning while soft version may be owning.

**Limitation**: In both version, `args` can contains no more than 1 type.

12. Render mental model:
* `mesh_data` component defines the geometry, color, uv,... information of drawn objects. It can be shared accross multiple entities.
* A `rendered_mesh` component corresponds to a drawn object in the scene. It holds reference to `mesh_data` component.
* There can be multiple cameras, but only the one with `main_camera` tag component will be used for rendering final image.
* Camera initially looks at Z+ direction, with its up vector being Y+.

13. Input
* Input systems will have their methods called for every event, unless one of them explicitly wants to exit. 
* The `event` paramter does not reflect realtime keyboard info. If you want to query realtime status:
```cpp
struct input_system {
    static void input(const event&, tree_context& ctx) {
        auto& window = ctx.vars().get<runtime_info>().window();
        if (window.get_key(scancode::enter) == key_status::pressed) {
            std::cout << "Enter pressed\n";
        }
    }
};
```

14. Component reference

It is common to reference a component from another component, for example a material component will need a texture component. It is dangerous to use pointer or reference directly because the actual component may be reallocated. This is similar to how we access elements of `std::vector` by their indices and not store reference to the element. It is best to use entity and query the component from the registry. 

There is a helper template class: `component_ref`. It stores the entity and component type.

```cpp
struct material {
    component_ref<texture> texture_ref;
};
// ...
auto mat = my_registry.get<material>(my_entity);
auto texture_comp = mat->texture_ref.get(my_registry);
// Equivalent to:
// auto texture_comp = my_registry.get<texture>(mat->texture_ref.entity());
```

15. Text

It's possible to display text in 3D environment with `st::text` component.

```cpp
entity font_en = /* ... */
entity text_en = /* ... */
registry.emplace<font>(font_en, "path/to/font/file");
registry.emplace<text>(text_en, text{
    .font=font_en,
    .content=u8"Hello",
    .size=30,
    .alignment = text::align::left,
});
```

Note that vertical alignment is at bottom.

16. Physics

stay3 uses *JoltPhysics* as its physics backend. There are basic functionalities such as:
* Rigidbody and Collider:
    * Rigidbody declares physics body settings such as `is_sensor`, `allow_sleep`. They are not modifiable after creation.
    * Collider defines the shape of the body. Having a collider means the entity has a physics representation in the backend.
* Collision detection:
    * I use a realtime query approach instead of callbacks. One can register checking for collision by adding component `collision_enter` to entity. 
```cpp
void setup(tree_context& ctx) {
    entity my_en = /* ... */;
    ctx.ecs().emplace<collision_enter>(my_en);
}

void update(seconds, tree_context& ctx) {
    entity my_en = /* ... */;
    for (const auto& col : ctx.ecs().get<collision_enter>(my_en)) {
        /* Access collision info here */
    }
}
```
* There is also `collision_stay` and `collision_exit` components
* **NOTE**: if `rigidbody::allow_sleep` was set to `true` which is the default, a contacting body pair will emit exit event when either of them goes to sleep. Set `allow_sleep` to `false` if it is not desirable.
* `rigidbody::dynamic` and `rigidbody::kinematic` entity will have a `motion` component attached. It can be used to change velocity and force or impulse of the body.
* Physics world transform state will be updated back to global transform component. It is best not to nest physics entity in deep node. 
* If user explicitly modifies local or global transform of a physics entity, its physics transform will be updated accordingly in `physics_system::update`.

17. Web build

Web build is based on [Emscripten toolchain](https://emscripten.org). There is a few limitations, some of them are because of how JavaScript and C++ works.

* There can only be one window instance at a time
* Consequently, there can only be one app instance at a time
* Most importantly, `app::run` ( and `app_launcher::launch`) does not start the app immediately like native version. It will schedule the app to run **AFTER** the `int main()` function returns. It brings some nuances and implications.
    * All internal data are stored inside the `app` instance. If you allocate an `app` in the stack and call its `run` method, the `app` will be destroyed before the game loop is even entered. So if you want to use `app`, you must allocate it somewhere else (static storage or the heap) so it will persist after `int main()`.
    * `app_launcher` is designed to solve this problem. Internally it allocates an `app` instance on the heap and does not free it in the destructor.
    * You should prefer `app_launcher` over `app` in both web and native builds.
* Alternatively, you can config `exit_main` properties of `app_config::web` to `false` when creating an instance. This will make the program behaves exactly like the native version. However, the rendering performance will be very poor [^2].

Please note these limitations are only relevant in the web context.

[^2]: Internally, the first approach uses JavaScript `requestAnimationFrame` to simulate a loop. This ensures proper synchronization between monitor, browser and our application. However, it requires control over our program execution, hence the weird limitations.
